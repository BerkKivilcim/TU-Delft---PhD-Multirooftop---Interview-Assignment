# 🏗️ LoD2 to LoD1 Conversion – TU Delft Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for converting LoD2 building models to LoD1. The code has been written in **Python** inside a **Jupyter Notebook** for better documentation and code readability. Therefore, the file format is `.ipynb` instead of `.py`.
